# ChurchPress Genesis Starter
A simple, sassified Genesis starter theme based off of [Genesis Sample 2.6.0](https://www.studiopress.com/sample/) and Sridhar Katakam's [Genesis Sample Sass](https://github.com/srikat/genesis-sample-sass). It also draws a little inspiration from Christoph Herr's [Prometheus starter theme](https://github.com/christophherr/prometheus).

This is the starter theme used to kick off development on many [ChurchPress](https://churchpress.co/) themes. It includes a few custom controls for the Customizer, should you want to implement them:

- Post Dropdown creates a dropdown selection of all your posts.
- Menu Dropdown creates a dropdown of your menus.
- TinyMCE adds a TinyMCE editor into the Customizer.

Knowledge of coding Customizer components into your theme is required for these to work. I've found [this guide](https://maddisondesigns.com/2017/05/the-wordpress-customizer-a-developers-guide-part-1/) to be particularly helpful for that.
